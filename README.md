# CS289-Myers-Briggs-Prediction
Myers Briggs Personality Type Prediction with Text Classification

Personality prediction has wide applications in various fields such as recruitment, recommendation systems, etc. However, traditional methods of assessments for personality prediction are often inefficient and time-consuming. The goal of our project is to using machine learning to build a classifier to automatically predict people's Myers-Briggs personality type based on texts from their social media posts. Our final implementation with Time Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features, and fine-tuned classical classifier achieves a best test accuracy of 67\%.
